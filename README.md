# Bone Fracture Detection using YOLOv8

This Jupyter Notebook explores the application of deep learning for bone fracture detection using a comprehensive X-ray image dataset.  The dataset is specifically designed for computer vision projects and aims to facilitate the development and evaluation of automated bone fracture detection algorithms.

## About the Dataset

The dataset encompasses X-ray images categorized into several classes, each representing a specific type of bone fracture within the upper extremities. These classes include:

*   Elbow Positive
*   Fingers Positive
*   Forearm Fracture
*   Humerus Fracture
*   Shoulder Fracture
*   Wrist Positive

Each image is annotated with either bounding boxes or pixel-level segmentation masks, precisely indicating the location and extent of the detected fracture. These annotations are crucial for training and evaluating bone fracture detection algorithms, particularly object detection models.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on automated fracture detection. Its diverse range of fracture classes enables the training of robust models capable of accurately identifying fractures in various regions of the upper extremities. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to accelerate the development of computer vision solutions for automated fracture detection, thereby contributing to advancements in medical diagnostics and improved patient care.
